# Note
This tool is modified from DSB2017.   
If any session from same subject passes segmentation preprocessing, this modified version ensures that all sessions pass segmentation preprocessing. It accepts two different files for single lung image processing. A few modification to data stracture is necessary in order for this code to work. In each session folder, instead of placing nifti file directly, place "to-be-processed file" in ```data``` folder, and place mask file in ```mask``` folder. Mask can be obtained by non-rigid co-register "to-be-processed" file with file of same subject that can be initially processed by DSB code, and take the inverse file.  

Intra-subject mask borrowing has been tested and verified. Inter-subject mask borrowing may also work, but not tested.

The tool is optimized for preprocessing only. To use nodule detection, replace ```full_prep.py``` under preprocesing folder to original file from DSB2017 GitHub.

# Instructions for runing


Assume subject X has two sessions that passed initial QA process, A and B. A successfully went through DSB Preprocessing while B failed to do so. The following instructions are to preprocess session B with the help of A
1. Input A as reference image and B as moving image to ANTsRegistrationSyNQuick, assuming output prefix is ```A2B```. Five files will be outputed: ```A2BWarp.nii.gz, A2B1Warp.nii.gz A2BInverseWarp.nii.gz, A2B1InverseWarp.nii.gz``` and ```A2B0GenericAffine.mat```.   

2. ```A2BInverseWarp.nii.gz``` will be the data of session A but closely mimic the content of session B in terms of the position and the shape of the lung w.r.t the voxel position in the data. The rationale is to use mask produced for ```A2BInverseWarp.nii.gz``` and apply such mask to session B.  

3. Under session B where there should be a Nifti file b, create a subfolder named ```data``` and move Nifti file b into the folder. Under the session B create another subfoler named ```mask``` and move ```A2BInverseWarp.nii.gz``` into the folder.  

4. Make the root path of this program point to subject X's folder, and run. 

# Idea

It is also possible that with ```A2BWarp.nii.gz, A2B1Warp.nii.gz A2BInverseWarp.nii.gz, A2B1InverseWarp.nii.gz``` and ```A2B0GenericAffine.mat```, we can save the  mask file of session A and deform it to fit session B with ```antsApplyTransform```, further eliminate the possibility that DSB failing to create masks
